## ` Inheritance-Java`

- One of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming – inheritance – enables us to reuse existing code or extend an existing type.

- Simply put, in Java, a class can inherit another class and multiple interfaces, while an interface can inherit other interfaces.

- When a class inherits another class or interfaces, apart from inheriting their members, it also inherits their type. This also applies to an interface that inherits other interfaces.

- This is a very powerful concept, which allows developers to program to an interface (base class or interface), rather than programming to their implementations.
